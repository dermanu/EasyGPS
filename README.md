# EasyGPS
This is one of my first programming projects. Using an Arduino UNO, a cheap LCD display, GPS reciever from eBay and LM35 for temperature messurments. This program displays time, course, hight, maximum speed and temperature. You can switch through this parameters using a button. 

The project was programmed in March 2013. So the by that time recent libraies (LiquidCrystal, SoftwareSerial, TinyGPS) are supported.

It's a farly easy software but might help someone to get started with Arduino.

I might upload a circuit sheet in the future.
